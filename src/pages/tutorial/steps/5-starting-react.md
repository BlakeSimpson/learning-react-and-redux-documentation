step: 5

## What is React?

[React](https://reactjs.org/) is a view rendering library developed and actively
maintained by a team of engineers at Facebook. I feel that first of all it is
helpful to clear up a common misconception about what React isn't, rather than
what it is.

React is not a framework but rather a library for developing user interfaces.
The React library does not come with routing, "models" or data management,
network request helpers, or even a test suite.

Since React has a large community around it there are however many libraries
that you can plug into your application that provide these features to you as a
developer in a "React way". For example,
[React Router](https://github.com/ReactTraining/react-router) for navigation or
[Redux](https://redux.js.org/) for managing data. To make a network request you
don't add something like jQuery you just use the browsers native `fetch` [^1]
method.

#### So, what exactly is React then?

The best explanation would come directly from Facebook: [^2]

> **Declarative**
>
> React makes it painless to create interactive UIs. Design simple views for
> each state in your application, and React will efficiently update and render
> just the right components when your data changes. Declarative views make your
> code more predictable and easier to debug.
>
> **Component-Based**
>
> Build encapsulated components that manage their own state, then compose them
> to make complex UIs. Since component logic is written in JavaScript instead of
> templates, you can easily pass rich data through your app and keep state out
> of the DOM.
>
> **Learn Once, Write Anywhere**
>
> We donâ€™t make assumptions about the rest of your technology stack, so you can
> develop new features in React without rewriting existing code. React can also
> render on the server using Node and power mobile apps using React Native.

#### Live updates / renders

Each React component has a `render` method that defines which DOM will be
returned when the component is rendered to the screen. As the Facebook
explanation states, React only updates the parts of your DOM that have changes
attached. It does this by using a virtual DOM to diff the current DOM in the
browser, calculating what needs to change, and only changing those parts.

React understands what will change by looking at `state` and `props`. React
components can have internal `state` which when changed causes a re-render of
the component. `props` are basically like HTML attributes, such as `href` for an
`<a>` tag. State can be passed down to child components via props and when these
change a re-render can also be triggered.

This means that React component can update to live changes. For an example see
the [Markdown example](https://reactjs.org/#a-component-using-external-plugins)
on the React.js homepage.

## What is JSX?

As mentioned in previous steps of this tutorial, React has a special syntax
called JSX. JSX is an "XML-Like Syntax for JavaScript". [^3]

Although it is possible to write React components without JSX, using vanilla
JavaScript, it is most common to use the JSX syntax. JSX can look very strange
if you have never worked with it before however it starts to feel very natural
after a little experience.

Let's take an example of a JSX React component and see what it would compile
down to. All JSX scripts should have a `.jsx` extension in order to
differentiate from standard JavaScript.

```jsx
// HelloMessage.jsx

class HelloMessage extends React.Component {
  render() {
    return <h1>Hello {this.props.name}</h1>;
  }
}

<HelloMessage name="Ned Stark" />;
```

This is a simple example but you can already see some of the fundamentals of
React. We have an ES6 `class`, extending the methods from the `React.Component`
class. We have the `render` method which returns the DOM that the component
should build. The JSX is an `<h1>` tag which as you can imagine is the same as
an `<h1>` in regular HTML. We then interpolate a dynamic variable into the
content of the H1, `this.props.name`. As can be seen on the final line, you pass
the `name` prop to the component the same way as an attribute in HTML.

The final output rendered to the web page would be:

```html
<h1>Hello Ned Stark</h1>
```

As I mentioned earlier, you do not necessarily have to write React in JSX
syntax. The previous code sample would compile down to:

```js
class HelloMessage extends React.Component {
  render() {
    return React.createElement('h1', null, 'Hello ', this.props.name);
  }
}

ReactDOM.render(
  React.createElement(HelloMessage, { name: 'Ned Stark' }),
  mountNode
);
```

Although this vanilla JS may look a little more natural, using JSX allows you to
work with the DOM and your logic in the same file. Even though it can feel like
"going backwards" against the standards you have learned in the past, having the
templating language alongside your logic directly in the JavaScript allows you
to keep all logic in one place.

For example, when using `jQuery`, you can bind click handlers from any file.
Suddenly when clicking on the page JavaScript logic is taking place but it can
be tricky to find out in which file that logic was defined. Somtimes the click
handlers override each other if defined multiple times in multiple files. When
working with a React component you know the logic will be within the Component
that you are working with, making your life as a developer easier.

## Writing our first Component

Now that we have a better understanding of React Components let's implement our
first one in the tutorial project.

We will start by installing the `react` dependency.

```bash
yarn add react
```

Next we will create a directory for our components and a directory for you main
`<App />` component that we are about to build.

Notice that custom React components always start with a capital letter and are
camel cased e.g. `<MyComponent />`. This allows us to differentiate between
React components and normal HTML tags, for example `<span>`, or `<a>`.

Start by creating the "App" directory inside of a "components" directory.

```bash
mkdir app/js/components
mkdir app/js/components/App
```

We can now create our "App" component in this directory by creating a file
called `App.jsx`. We will start by importing `React` and `Component` into the
file.

Note: Whenever you use JSX in a file, you must import `React` even if you do not
use the variable directly, otherwise the component will not compile and you will
see the following console error:

![Img: Error thrown when React is not imported](img/error-no-react-import.png)

```jsx
// app/js/components/App/App.jsx

import React, { Component } from 'react';
```

Next we will create a class called `App`, extended from `Component`, that has a
`render` method.

```jsx
// app/js/components/App/App.jsx

import React, { Component } from 'react';

class App extends Component {
  render() {}
}
```

We can now specify the content that we want to render on the web page.

```jsx
// app/js/components/App/App.jsx

import React, { Component } from 'react';

class App extends Component {
  render() {
    return <p>Rendered by React</p>;
  }
}
```

Finally we will specify that `App` is the default export for this JavaScript
module.

```jsx
// app/js/components/App/App.jsx

import React, { Component } from 'react';

class App extends Component {
  render() {
    return <p>Rendered by React</p>;
  }
}

export default App;
```

### Managing imports

When importing from JavaScript modules the file `index.js` will automatically be
loaded if no filename is specified in the import in the file path. i.e.`import
components/App;` is the same as `import components/App/index;`

For this reason we will always define an `index.js` file that is responsible for
exporting the classes and functions defined within out component files.

To do this we create an `index.js` file in our "App" directory and export the
default component from there.

```js
// app/js/components/App/index.js

export { default } from './App';
```

## Render the app with React DOM

React DOM is responsible for selecting the DOM node that will contain the React
application and rendering the compiled DOM contents of our `<App />` component
into it. First of all add the package via `yarn`.

```bash
yarn add react-dom
```

Finally we will update our `application.js` file to import the `render` method
from `react-dom`, import our `<App />` component, select the `#app` div that we
have already added to our `index.html` file and glue it all together.

```js
// app/js/application.js

import React from 'react';
import { render } from 'react-dom';

import App from './components/App';

render(<App />, document.getElementById('app'));
```

Build the bundled JavaScript again by running `yarn dev` and open `index.html`
in your browser to see "Rendered by React" in a paragraph tag on the page.

## Stateless Functional Components

Finally we can clean our `App` component up a little. Since React 14 [^4] we no
longer necessarily need to import `Component` and use a class for a React
component. If the component does not need to use internal state or lifecycle
methods (such as `componentWillMount`, `componentDidMount`, etc.) you can simply
use a function that returns the JSX content. Let's refactor the `<App />`
component to see an example.

This is called a "stateless functional component" (SFC) because the component
will never have an internal `state` and the component is expressed as a simple
function instead of a class.

```jsx
// app/js/components/App/App.jsx

import React from 'react';

const App = () => {
  return <p>Rendered by React</p>;
};

export default App;
```

Run `yarn build` again and refresh `index.html` and you will see the content of
the browser are still the same.
