## What are we building?

Since it seems everyone loves _A Game of Thrones_, myself included, we will be building "A Map of Thrones". This project is an interactive map of _Westeros_ with pointers on the map that we can click to view additional information. We can even add places to our favourites list.

The application is fairly simple to build but it has enough complexity to it that we need various Webpack loaders, we will have a few different React components, and also have a simple use case to try out Redux.

Finally we will take the completed app and convert it to TypeScript, in order to get a feel for the TypeScript syntax and start to understand why adding typing can help improve your codebase.
