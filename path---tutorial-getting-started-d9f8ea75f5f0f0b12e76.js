This project is an interactive map of <em>Westeros</em> with pointers on the map that we can click to view additional information. We can even add places to our favourites list.</p>\n<p>The application is fairly simple to build but it has enough complexity to it that we need various Webpack loaders, we will have a few different React components, and also have a simple use case to try out Redux.</p>\n<p>Finally we will take the completed app and convert it to TypeScript, in order to get a feel for the TypeScript syntax and start to understand why adding typing can help improve your codebase. </p>',frontmatter:{title:"Getting Started",step:1}},allMarkdownRemark:{edges:[{node:{fields:{slug:"/tutorial/getting-started/"},frontmatter:{title:"Getting Started",step:1}}},{node:{fields:{slug:"/tutorial/links/"},frontmatter:{title:"Links",step:null}}}]}},pathContext:{slug:"/tutorial/getting-started/"}}}});
